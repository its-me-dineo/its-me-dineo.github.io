# Commissions

Commissions are case by case. Prices are based of work and time invested, and experience.

I want to learn far and great lengths. If what I provide here isn't enough, contact me and ask, I want to push to provide something better and provide something you want.

- Simple, 0-59s, short form content: ~$2.
- Not simple, 0-59s, short form content: ~$3.
- Simple, 2-5m, standard video content: ~$5.

Likely to increase cost:

- Abundance of detailed masking.
- Abundance of movement.

Contact me by sending me a DM on Discord: `@dinooooooooooooooooo`.

# Payment

I don't have a uniform payment method yet. I'm very open to forms of payment currently, including Twitch Gifted Subs, Steam games, Gift cards, and other forms of payment. 

"Dino credit" is also open for use! If you are worried about not finding a suitable payment method. If you overpay, the amount overpaid can be used to fund other commissions by me!
