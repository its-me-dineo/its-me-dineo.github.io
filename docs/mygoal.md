# My Goal

- I want to learn and grow to become a great video editor. 
- I want to be able to do any video editing style.
- I want to offer affordable video editing skill to indie content creators.
- I want to offer editing skill to anyone who wants it!

IM DINO!!! Hello! I'm excited to have you here. Want to work together? I'm here for you :D

I want to create videos and edits I'm or others are proud of. I know I will always have something to learn, and I will learn it, I will make better and better edits.

I'm also really big into communication. You have a question? Ask it! No real pain is just asking. If you request a commission, I'm 1000% open to hearing everything of the little edits you want, what style you'd like, or just a specific special effect. That's why I have "unlimited" revisions, I want you to get your vision, and I want to be able to provide it.
