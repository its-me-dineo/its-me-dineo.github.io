- 

Basic guidelines.

- I can refuse any commission.
- I can refuse to continue work.
- I can refuse to revisit previous work.
- I can refuse any type of payment.
- I have ownership of work produced.
- You will be sent updates, asked for feedback, and sent a full resolution final file.

# Ownership

I own the work I create. I should be credited in the same post of where the content I created is posted. Preferred credit is "Edited: @dinospond on Twitter".

When you buy my work. You are paying to create my work and buying rights to post my work. You lose rights to your bought product if content is posted maliciously. Including but not limited to, to target, harass, or bully people or persons.

# Commissions

Commissions are case by case. Prices are based of work and time invested, and experience. 

- Simple 0-59s short form content - ~$2.
- Not simple 0-59s short form content - ~$3
- Simple 2-5m standard form content - ~$5

Likely to increase cost:

- Abundance of detailed masking 
- Abundance of movement

# Payment

I don't have a uniform payment method yet. I'm very open to forms of payment currently, including Twitch Gifted Subs, Steam games, Gift cards, and other forms of payment. "Dino credit" is also open for use!
