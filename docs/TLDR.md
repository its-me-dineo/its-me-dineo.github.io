# Me! Dino!

IM DINO!!! Hello! I'm excited to have you here. Want to work together? I'm here for you :D

I want to create videos and edits I'm or others are proud of. I know I will always have something to learn, and I will learn it, I will make better and better edits.

I'm also really big into communication. You have a question? Ask it! No real pain is just asking. If you request a commission, I'm 1000% open to hearing everything of the little edits you want, what style you'd like, or just a specific special effect. That's why I have "unlimited" revisions, I want you to get your vision, and I want to be able to provide it.

If you want some of my work, THANK YOU! Keep reading to get caught up on my Terms of Service and Guidelines to learn about my human limits <3.

# Ownership

I own the work I create. I should be credited in the same post of where the content I created is posted. Preferred credit is "Edited: @dinospond on Twitter".

When you buy my work. You are paying for me to create my work and buying rights to post your commision of my work. You lose rights to your bought product if it's posted maliciously. Including but not limited to, to target, harass, or bully people or persons.

# Commissions

Commissions are case by case. Prices are based of work and time invested, and experience.

- Simple, 0-59s, short form content: ~$2.
- Not simple, 0-59s, short form content: ~$3.
- Simple, 2-5m, standard video content: ~$5.

Likely to increase cost:

- Abundance of detailed masking.
- Abundance of movement.

# Payment

I don't have a uniform payment method yet. I'm very open to forms of payment currently, including Twitch Gifted Subs, Steam games, Gift cards, and other forms of payment. 

"Dino credit" is also open for use! If you overpay, the amount overpaid can be used to fund other commissions by me!
